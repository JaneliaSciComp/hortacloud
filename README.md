# janeliaHortaCloud

JaneliaHortaCloud is a streaming 3D annotation platform for large microscopy data that runs entirely in the cloud. It is based on the [Janelia Workstation](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/workstation) software and was originally developed in support of the [MouseLight Team Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight). 

It combines state-of-the-art volumetric visualization, advanced features for 3D neuronal annotation, and real-time multi-user collaboration with a set of enterprise-grade backend microservices for moving and processing large amounts of data rapidly and securely. JaneliaHortaCloud takes advantage of cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to perform all 3D rendering in cloud-leased GPUs which are data-adjacent, and only transfer a high-fidelity interactive video stream to each annotatorâ€™s local compute platform through a web browser.

## Getting Started

To make use of this repo, you should have **node v14** installed on your local machine. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and activate this version of node. You should also install the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and configure it with your AWS account information.

After cloning this repo, run `npm run setup` to download dependencies.

Then you can run `npm run deploy` to build and deploy the code.

## Implementation details

The deployment uses AWS CDK to create AWS resources on your AWS account as shown in the diagram below. All services run in a secured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

### Deployment examples

To a specific stage of the services and vpc stacks use the example below:

```
HORTA_STAGE=prod
HORTA_ORG=janelia
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=<adminuser>@<organization>

ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=${ADMIN_USER_EMAIL} HORTA_STAGE=${HORTA_STAGE} npm run deploy
```
