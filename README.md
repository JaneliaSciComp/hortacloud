# janeliaHortaCloud

JaneliaHortaCloud is a streaming 3D annotation platform for large microscopy data that runs entirely in the cloud. It is based on the [Janelia Workstation](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/workstation) software and was originally developed in support of the [MouseLight Team Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight). 

It combines state-of-the-art volumetric visualization, advanced features for 3D neuronal annotation, and real-time multi-user collaboration with a set of enterprise-grade backend microservices for moving and processing large amounts of data rapidly and securely. JaneliaHortaCloud takes advantage of cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to perform all 3D rendering in cloud-leased GPUs which are data-adjacent, and only transfer a high-fidelity interactive video stream to each annotatorâ€™s local compute platform through a web browser.

## Getting Started

To make use of this repo, you should have **node v14** installed on your local machine. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and activate this version of node. You should also install the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and configure it with your AWS account information.

After cloning this repo, run `npm run setup` to download dependencies.

Then you can run `npm run deploy` to build and deploy the code.

## Implementation details

The deployment uses AWS CDK to create AWS resources on your AWS account as shown in the diagram below. All services run in a secured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

### Deployment examples

The full deployment of the application requires 3 steps. 
1) Deploy the back-end stacks - this includes the appstream builder
2) Connect to appstream builder and install the workstation application. This is a semiautomated step that involves copying and running two PowerShell scripts onto the appstream builder instance.
3) Deploy the front-end stacks 


#### Back-end and front-end stacks deployment
To deploy the backend and frontend stacks use the example below in which the `<step>` can be `backend` or `frontend`

```
HORTA_STAGE=prod
HORTA_ORG=janelia
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=<adminuser>@<organization>

ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=${ADMIN_USER_EMAIL} HORTA_STAGE=${HORTA_STAGE} npm run deploy-<step>
```

#### Client app installation
For client installation start and connect to the appstream builder instance then copy the following scripts from this repo to the appstream instance:
- [installcmd.ps1](vpc_stack/src/asbuilder/installcmd.ps1) - installs JDK and the workstation
- [createappimage.ps1](vpc_stack/src/asbuilder/createappimage.ps1) - creates the appstream image

After you copied or created the scripts:
* open an "Administrator Power Shell" window
* Run `installcmd.ps1 <serverName>` where <serverName> is the name of the backend EC2 instance - typically it looks like ` ip-<ip4 with digits instead of dots>.ec2.internal`. This will install the JDK and the workstation. When the workstation installer prompts you for the install directory select `C:\apps` as the JaneliaWorkstation location.
* Run `c:\apps\runJaneliaWorkstation.ps1` and create the users
* Run `createappimage.ps1`. Keep in mind that once you start this step the builder instance begins the snapshotting process and it will not be usable until it completes. After this is completed the appstream image should be available and the builder is in a stop state. To use it again you need to start it and then you can connect to it again.
