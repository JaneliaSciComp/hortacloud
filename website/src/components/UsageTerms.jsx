                The purposes of this demo website is to be able to experiment with the HortaCloud volumetric viewer
                to view 3D Mouse Brain samples, view and experiment with annotation of neurons in these samples, and
                get a better understanding of how the browser functions.  Because of this, user accounts are
                limited to 7 days and will be automatically removed once they expire.  Also any annotations or work
                done in the demo are not intended to be saved and will be periodically removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to spend a longer period of time experimenting with HortaCloud or would like to
                interact and annotate Mouselight data, please email us at <Button
                variant="primary"
                as="a"

                Email Us
            </Button> and we can
                create a user account in our Janelia HortaCloud instance.
